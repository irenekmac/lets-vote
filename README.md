After taking a long break from coding for health reasons I wanted to start on some easy projects as I've had to review a lot of what i've learnt from my time in General Assembly.

## About this web app

This is a simple vote poll which increments a vote on every click.

## What I learnt

* How props work
* onClick events
* React components
* Constructor methods
* How to use state objects
